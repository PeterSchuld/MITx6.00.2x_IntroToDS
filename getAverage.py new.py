    num_trials: integer, number of trials to run
    probs: list of probabilities of guessing correctly for 
           the ith food, in each trial
    cost: float, how much to pay for each food guess
    get: float, how much you get for a correct guess
    
    Runs a Monte Carlo simulation, 'num_trials' times. In each trial 
    you guess what each food is, the ith food has 'prob[i]' probability 
    to get it right. For every food you guess, you pay 'cost' dollars.
    If you guess correctly, you get 'get' dollars. 
    
    Returns: a tuple of the mean and standard deviation over 
    'num_trials' trials of the net money earned 
    when making len(probs) guesses
