# MITx6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
An introduction to using computation to understand real-world phenomena. John Guttag, Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

This course is the second of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. 

6.00.2x will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.

Topics covered include:

    Advanced programming in Python 3
    Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
    Dynamic programming
    Plotting with the pylab package
    Random walks
    Probability, Distributions
    Monte Carlo simulations
    Curve fitting
    Statistical fallacies
